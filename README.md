Statistical Analysis Protocol to Identify Homogeneous Subtypes in Clinical Data 
* Data preparation (scale, adjust, feature selection, sample selection, exploratory data analysis)
* Mixture Model Clustering (based on R mclust)
* Model Selection (model ranking, BIC quantiles, top-N models)
* Characterization and Comparison of Models (visualize heatmaps, parallel coordinates, cross compare models)
* Validation of Subtypes (application specific inference methods: risk ratio, chi2, ...)
