	abstract = {The clinical heterogeneity of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) may point at the existence of subtypes. Because subtypes likely reflect distinct underlying etiologies, their identification may facilitate future genetic and pharmacotherapeutic studies. Aim of this study was to identify subtypes by a data-driven approach applied to a broad spectrum of motor and nonmotor features of PD. Data of motor and nonmotor PD symptoms were collected in 802 patients in two different European prevalent cohorts. A model-based cluster analysis was conducted on baseline data of 344 patients of a Dutch cohort (PROPARK). Reproducibility of these results was tested in data of the second annual assessment of the same cohort and validated in an independent Spanish cohort (ELEP) of 357 patients. The subtypes were subsequently characterized on clinical and demographic variables. Four similar PD subtypes were identified in two different populations and are largely characterized by differences in the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications: Subtype 1 was mildly affected in all domains, Subtype 2 was predominantly characterized by severe motor complications, Subtype 3 was affected mainly on nondopaminergic domains without prominent motor complications, while Subtype 4 was severely affected on all domains. The subtypes had largely similar mean disease durations (nonsignificant differences between three clusters) but showed considerable differences with respect to their association with demographic and clinical variables. In prevalent disease, PD subtypes are largely characterized by the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications and likely reflect complex interactions between disease mechanisms, treatment, aging, and gender. {\textcopyright} 2010 Movement Disorder Society.},

	abstract = {Aggressive tumour types such as glioblastomas (gl) and metastases (me) are known to be difficult to discriminate on the basis of single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SV 1H-MRS) information. Each of them is also heterogeneous in nature and a statistically robust subtyping analysis is likely to shed light on their structure and, possibly, on their differences. In this brief paper we carry out such analysis. From the original MRS frequencies and their first derivative approximation, the most discriminant variables are first selected by χ(2)-testing. Subtypes are then discovered in the distribution of gl and me by repeated model based cluster analysis. Then, the mean of each subtype is contrasted with the original distribution of MRS spectra by t-testing with tail probabilities for the proportion of false positive (TPPFP) control. Finally, the distribution of gl and me in each subtype is compared with random expectation by χ(2)-testing. The experimental results confirm the existence of consistent subtypes. They exhibit relative proportions of gl and me very unlikely to occur at random.},

	abstract = {We aim to identify subtypes of diseases like Osteoarthritis (OA) and Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Disease (PD) that present clinical heterogeneity. We do so by searching for homogeneous clusters in values of markers that reflect the severity of the disease. In the current paper we consider two important items for a cluster analysis. First, as time can contribute largely to the measured variability in the data, we search for the most appropriate way to adjust for it. Second, as we aim for reliable cluster analyses, cluster results should exhibit robustness to little change in the data. To investigate these issues, we transform the data by adding noise of different levels before cluster modeling and we rely on a chi(2)-based measure of association to compare cluster results for different types of time adjustment. The results of our experiments suggest to adjust data for a logarithmic age effect for OA and a square root effect of the disease duration for PD because these adjustments lead more reliable cluster results.},

We applied this methodology to medical research on Osteoarthritis and Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Disease and to chemoinformatics research on the chemical structure of molecule profiles. We release this methodology as the R SubtypeDiscovery package to enable reproducibility of our analyses. In this paper, we present the package implementation and we illustrate its output on molecular data from chemoinformatics. Our methodology includes different techniques to process the data, a computational approach repeating data modelling to select for a number of subtypes or a type of model, and additional methods to characterize, compare and evaluate the top ranking models. Therefore, this methodology does not solely cluster data but it also produces a complete set of results to conduct a subtype discovery analysis. },
